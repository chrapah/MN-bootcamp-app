# Secure Development Checklist

Name: NELLY
Date: 5th November 2026

## 1. Pipeline map

| Stage | Security activity | Example tool | Gate (what blocks progress) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plan | Write security requirements and assess risk | Checklist, gap analysis | Requirements approved |
| Design | Threat modelling | STRIDE | Top threats have countermeasures |
| Code | Scan while you type and peer review | SonarQube for IDE, Snyk IDE plugin | No hard-coded secrets, pull request reviewed |
| Build | SAST, SCA and secrets scan | Snyk, Dependency-Check | No new High or Critical findings |
| Test | Security tests and DAST | OWASP ZAP, penetration test | No open High findings |
| Deploy | Harden configuration and protect secrets | Security headers, secrets manager | Configuration checklist signed off |
| Operate | Monitor, patch and audit | Dependabot, logs, scheduled scans | Critical patches within agreed time |

## 2. My own additions (one more security activity for each stage)

- Plan: Define data classification and decide which data needs encryption or stricter access control.
- Design: Review authentication and session management design for common flaws (e.g. weak session handling ) 
- Code: Run secret scanning in the IDE before committing to catch API keys and passwords early.
- Build: Generate and store an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for every build.
- Test: Include abuse-case and negative testing (e.g. broken access control, injection attempts).
- Deploy: Enforce HTTPS only and set secure security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.).
- Operate: Subscribe to security advisories for all third-party components and review them weekly.

## 3. My pass or fail rules for three gates

1. Gate: Build. Rule: the build fails if Snyk reports any High or Critical issue.
2. Gate:
3. Gate:

## 4. SonarQube for IDE warnings I saw in app.js
This framework implicitly discloses version information by default.Make sure it is safe here

Improper input validation exposed sensitive data /information from the database to an unauthorised user/client 

Solution: Propere input validation (by design) to prevent unauthorised data exposure.
